Done: All the features
-Ask user for a list of locations and limit temperatures to monitor.
-Periodically request weather service.
-Check if any limit is exceeded in the next five days.
-Show the weather service results and possible alerts.
-The checking period must be configurable by end user.
-The displayed result must contain the checked locations, their weather forecasts and alert status.
-The program must handle any network issue.

Optionals: 
-Implement a backend service that records generated alerts into a log file.
-How would you improve the current application architecture to better separate concerns?
